    <h4>GERMAN CHOCOLATE JIMBO CAKE RECIPE<h4>
<img src="http://milkbarstore.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Cakes_GCJ.jpg" style="width:100%" alt="Image">
<hr>
<h5>Cake Assembly Insrtuction:</h5>

<h5>1. put a piece of parchment or a silpat on the counter. invert the cake onto it and peel off the parchment or silpat from the bottom of the cake. use the cake ring to stamp out 2 circles from the cake. these are your top 2 cake layers. the remaining cake “scrap” will come together to make the bottom layer of the cake.
layer 1, the bottom
<br><br>
2. clean the cake ring and place it in the center of a sheet pan lined with clean parchment or a silpat. use 1 strip of acetate to line the inside of the cake ring.
<br><br>
3. put the cake scraps together inside the ring and use the back of your hand to tamp the scraps together into a flat even layer.
<br><br>
4. dunk a pastry brush in the malt cake soak and give the layer of cake a good, healthy bath of the soak.
<br><br>
5. use the back of a spoon to spread 1/2 recipe of the crack-coconut filling in an even layer over the cake.
<br><br>
6. sprinkle half of the pecan crunch evenly over the crack-coconut filling. use the back of your hand to anchor in place.
<br><br>
7. use the back of a spoon to spread one-third of the chocolate malt frosting over the pecan crunch layer.
layer 2, the middle
<br><br>
8. with your index finger, gently tuck the second strip of acetate between the cake ring and the top ¼ inch of the first strip of acetate, so that you have a clear ring of acetate 5 to 6 inches tall – high enough to support the height of the finished cake. set a cake round on top of the frosting, and repeat the process for layer 1 (if 1 of your 2 cake rounds is jankier than the other, use it here in the middle and save the prettier one for the top).
layer 3, the top
<br><br>
9. nestle the remaining cake round into the frosting. cover the top of the cake with the remaining frosting. give it volume and swirls, or do as we do and opt for a perfectly flat top. garnish the frosting with toasted, shredded coconut.
<br><br>
10. transfer the sheet pan to the freezer and freeze for a minimum of 12 hours to set the cake and fillings. the cake will keep in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.
<br><br>
11. at least 3 hours before you are ready to serve the cake, pull the sheet pan out of the freezer and, using your fingers and thumbs, pop the cake out of the cake ring. gently peel off the acetate, and transfer the cake to a platter or cake stand. let it defrost in the fridge for a minimum of 3 hours (wrapped well in plastic, the cake can be refrigerated for up to 5 days).
<br><br>
12. slice the cake into wedges and serve.

      <h4>JAMAICAN BEEF PATTY</h4>

            <hr>
          <h5>DIRECTIONS:<h5>

          Make the crust: Combine flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder, and pinch of salt. 
          <br> Cut in 1/4 cup margarine and shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in water until mixture forms a ball. 
          <br> Do not overstir; that makes tough crust. Shape dough into a log, and cut into 10 equal sections. Roll each section into a six inch circle (approximately 1/8 inch thick). Set aside.
          <br> Next, prepare the filling.: Melt margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion until soft and translucent. Stir in ground beef. Season with 1 teaspoon curry powder, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper. 
          <br> Cook until beef is browned, stirring constantly. Stir in beef broth and bread crumbs. Simmer until liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat.
          <br>Now make the patties: Spoon some filling into each pastry circle. Fold over and press edges together, making a half circle. Use a fork to press edges, and brush the top of each patty with beaten egg.
          <br> Bake in preheated 375 degree oven for 25 - 30 minutes, or until golden brown.
          <br><br> NOTE: If you have the time and organization, it might be best to make the filling in advance, long enough to cool down before fillng the pastry. Otherwise, it might melt the pastry somewhat. Just a thought from a review on another recipe.

<br>1 tablespoon Caribbean Green Seasoning

<br>1 tablespoon veg oil
<br>1/2 scotch bonnet pepper (no seeds / optional)
<br>1 tablespoon brown sugar or honey (optional)
<br>4 slices of orange</h5>
<hr>
<h5>DIRECTION:</h5>
 <h5>You can use your fav fish for this recipe.. I much prefer ocean fish though. <br>You’ll need about 1.5-2 cups of veg oil for frying the fish.
<br>The fist thing we’ll do is season the fish to allow it time to marinate while we make the orange ginger sauce.<br> Please note that this sauce will be a bit ‘hot’ with the scotch bonnet pepper and the natural heat from the ginger, but you can certainly tame it down by leaving out the scotch bonnet pepper. <br>Wash the fish pieces with some lime or lemon juice and rinse with water (not mentioned in the ingredient list). Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Then season (mix well) with the salt, black pepper and Caribbean Green Seasoning. <br>Allow this to marinate for 10-15 minutes.
